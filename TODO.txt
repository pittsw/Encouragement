Adjust visit interface (size of things?)
Consider switching to a 4/8/4 column layout and making the font size smaller on the details page. User testing shows that it draws way too much attention.
Consider replacing white text in message boxes with black, for readability, and making the backgrounds lighter colors to go with (also user testing).
Possibly implement rounded corners again? (again, user testing)
Start on a client upon refreshing page, to prevent send message errors.
Fix the height of the page so it maxes out vertically at the size of the window, and individual sections scroll instead of the whole thing.

Fix all the things!
