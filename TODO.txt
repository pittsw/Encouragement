Adjust visit interface (size of things?)
Consider switching to a 4/8/4 column layout and making the font size smaller on the details page. User testing shows that it draws a bit too much attention.
Consider replacing white text in message boxes with black, for readability, and making the backgrounds lighter colors to go with. Possibly implement rounded corners again?

Fix all the things!
