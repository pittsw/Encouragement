Add messages to csv output
Maybe move the script mentioned ~line 50 of encouragement.js out of message_listmode.html.
Javascript up some button pressing effects.
Add the language(s) spoken by the patient.
Indicate whether a phone was shared or personal.
Provide more granularity than just the morning/evening/afternoon for message frequency. For example, 8-10 a.m., 2-4 p.m., 7-10 p.m.
Clear phone call needs to clear everything in the div, not just the content.
Sending messages needs to not overwrite the current display setting (adding a message from list mode should not result in switching to conversation mode)
Gets REALLY slow with over 1000 messages.


Fix all the things!
